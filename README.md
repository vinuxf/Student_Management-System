## Student Management System

The Student Management System is a comprehensive Java-based application designed to efficiently manage student records within an educational institution. Leveraging Java Swing for a user-friendly interface and MySQL for robust data storage, this system facilitates seamless management of student data including addition, search, deletion, and update of student details.

### Key Features:
1. **User Authentication:** Implemented a secure login system to authenticate users and ensure data privacy.
2. **Student CRUD Operations:** Allows administrators to add, search, delete, and update student records with ease.
3. **Intuitive User Interface:** Designed using Java Swing, providing a visually appealing and intuitive user experience.
4. **Data Persistence:** Utilized MySQL database for efficient storage and retrieval of student information, ensuring data integrity and reliability.
5. **Error Handling:** Implemented robust error handling mechanisms to provide users with informative error messages and ensure system stability.
6. **Scalability:** Designed with scalability in mind, allowing for easy expansion and customization to meet evolving institutional requirements.
7. **Cross-Platform Compatibility:** Developed using Java, ensuring compatibility across different operating systems.

### Technologies Used:
- **Java:** Core programming language used for application logic and user interface development.
- **Java Swing:** GUI toolkit used to create rich graphical user interfaces.
- **MySQL:** Relational database management system used for data storage and retrieval.
- **XAMPP:** Local server environment used for MySQL database hosting and testing.

### How to Use:
1. Ensure that Java and XAMPP are installed on your system.
2. Start the Apache and MySQL services in XAMPP.
3. Import the provided MySQL database schema into your local MySQL server.
4. Compile and run the Java application.
5. Log in with the provided credentials to access the Student Management System(username-vihanga/ password-3854).
6. Begin managing student records by adding, searching, deleting, or updating student details as required.

### Future Enhancements:
- Incorporate additional features such as attendance tracking, grade management, and report generation.
- Improve user interface design for enhanced usability and aesthetics.
- Implement advanced security measures to further safeguard sensitive student data.
